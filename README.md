# Product-AB-Testing

This project is focused on GloBox, an e-commerce enterprise recognized for its boutique fashion items and premium decor products. Nevertheless, the company has witnessed substantial growth in its food and beverage offerings over recent months. To capitalize on this expansion and amplify revenue, the company seeks to raise awareness of this product category. Consequently, an A/B test has been proposed to spotlight food and beverage products through a banner. The primary objective of this test is to gauge its influence on user behavior, with a specific emphasis on purchases and conversions.
